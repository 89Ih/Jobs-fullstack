# Jobseeker Application
![Jobseeker Application](./jobs-Frontend/public/favicon.ico)

This is a jobseeker application built with **React** and **TypeScript**, leveraging the design power of **Material UI** and **Tailwind CSS**.

The application seamlessly integrates with **Microsoft Dataverse** to retrieve published job opportunities. Candidates can browse these opportunities and apply directly through the application. When a candidate submits their application, it is saved in Dataverse, where it can be analyzed by a custom recruiting app built with **Power Apps** within the **Power Platform**.

## Key Features
- **Job Listings**: Fetches and displays job opportunities from Microsoft Dataverse.
- **Application Submission**: Allows candidates to apply for jobs, saving their application data back to Dataverse.
- **Custom Recruiting Integration**: The saved application data can be analyzed by a custom recruiting app built on Power Apps.
- **Modern Design**: The UI is crafted using Material UI for component design and Tailwind CSS for responsive layouts.

## Technologies Used
- **React & TypeScript**: For building a robust and scalable front-end application.
- **Material UI & Tailwind CSS**: For creating a modern and responsive user interface.
